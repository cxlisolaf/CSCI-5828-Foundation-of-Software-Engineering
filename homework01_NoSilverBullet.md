- Define the term essential difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an essential difficulty.

    Brooks defines the essential difficulties as the difficulties inherent in the nature of software. 
    
    He thinks the essence of a software entity is a construct of interlocking concepts: data sets, relationships among data items, algorithms, and invocations of functions. This essence is abstract in that such a conceptual construct is the same under many different representations. It is nonetheless highly precise and richly detailed. Brooks believes the hard part of building software to be the specification, design, and testing of this conceptual construct, not the labor of representing it and testing the fidelity of the representation. The syntax errors are fuzz compared with the conceptual errors in most systems. If this is true, building software will always be hard and inherently no silver bullet to solve. 
    
    For example,  complexity property of software comes with the difficulty of communication among team members, which leads to product flaws, cost overruns, schedule delays.

- Define the term accidental difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an accidental difficulty.

    Brooks defined the accidental difficulties as those difficulties that today attend its production but are not inherent. 

- List and briefly describe the four essential difficulties of developing software systems that Brooks identifies. Provide additional examples of each type of the four essential difficulties.

- Define what Brooks means by a silver bullet and reconstruct his argument as to why he believes there is no silver bullet for software engineering.

- In lecture, software engineering's relationship to computer science was described by analogy by discussing the differences between a chemist (chemistry) and a chemical engineer (chemical engineering). Define software engineering and its relationship to computer science; make use of the chemist vs. chemical engineer analogy when answering this question.

- In lecture, we discussed the importance of the following concepts to software engineers: abstractions, conversations, specification, translation, and iteration. Define each of these concepts as they are related to software engineering and discuss their importance.
